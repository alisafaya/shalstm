=== Ancient Egypt ===
''Main articles: [[History of Ancient Egypt]], [[Kush]]''

Africa's earliest evidence of written history was in [[Ancient Egypt]], and the [[Egyptian calendar]] is still used as the standard for dating [[bronze age]] and [[iron age]] cultures throughout the region.

In about 3100 B.C., [[Egypt]] was united under a ruler known as Mena, or [[Menes]], who inaugurated the first of the 30 dynasties intowhich Egypt's ancient history is divided: the [[Old Kingdom|Old]], [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]s and the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. The pyramids at [[Giza]] (near [[Cairo]]), which were built in the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]], testify to the power of the pharaonic religion and state. The [[Great Pyramid]], the tomb of [[Pharaoh]] [[Khufu]] (also known as Cheops), is the only surviving monument of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Ancient Egypt reached the peak of its power, wealth, and territorial extent in the period called the New Empire (1567-1085 B.C.).

The Egyptians reached [[Crete]] around 2000 BC and were invaded by [[Indo-European]]s and [[Hyksos]] Semites. They defeated the invaders around 1570 BC and expanded into the [[Aegean sea|Aegean]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], and much of the [[Levant]], as far as the [[Euphrates]].

The importance of Ancient Egypt to the development of Africa has been disputed. The earlier generation of Western [[Africanist]]s generally saw Egypt as a Mediterranean civilization with little impact on the rest of Africa. The more recent historians based in Africa take a very different view seeing Egypt as important to the development of African civilization as Greece was to the development of European. It has been demonstrated that Egypt had considerable contact with [[Ethiopia]] and the upper [[Nile]] valley, south of the [[cataracts of the Nile]] in [[Nubia]]n [[Kush]]. Links and connections to the Sahel and West Africa have been proposed, but are as of yet unproven.

=== Phoenician, Greek and Roman colonization  ===
Separated by the 'sea of sand', the Sahara, [[North Africa]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] have been linked by fluctuating [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes. Phoenician, Greek and Roman history of North Africa can be followed in entries for the [[Roman Empire]] and for its individual provinces in the [[Maghreb]], such as [[Mauretania]], [[Africa (province)|Africa]], [[Tripolitania]], [[Cyrenaica]], [[Aegyptus (province)|Aegyptus]] etc.

In Northern Africa Ethiopia has been the only state which throughout historic times has (except for a brief period during [[World War II]]) maintained its independence.  Countries bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] were colonised and settled by the [[Phoenicia]]ns before 1000 BC. [[Carthage]], founded about [[814 BC]], speedily grew into a city without rival in the Mediterranean. The Phoenicians subdued the [[Berber]] tribes who, then as now, formed the bulk of the population, and became masters of all the habitable region of North Africa west of the [[Great Syrtis]], and found in commerce a source of immense prosperity.

Greeks founded the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in Libya around [[631 BC]]. [[Cyrenaica]] became a flourishing colony, though being hemmed in on all sides by absolute desert it had little or no influence on inner Africa.  The Greeks, however, exerted a powerful influence in Egypt.  To [[Alexander the Great]] the city of [[Alexandria]] owes its foundation ([[332 BC]]), and under the Hellenistic dynasty of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] attempts were made to penetrate southward, and in this way was obtained some knowledge of Ethiopia.

The three powers of Cyrenaica, Egypt and Carthage were even|-start-of-generated-text-| united (some believe there is a tension betweenthe Turks, the Celts and the Romans in Rome led by Bibya), and the Late Levant seized many democratic and dominant religious backgrounds but was embassyed under [[Roman Empire|Roman houses]]. After creating the [[Palestine Dynasty]], the three originators of Ancient Egypt were the subject of instances by [[Michael VII of Rome|Michael VII]] of Rome, in [[Mesopotamia]] (excluding the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[Western Isles]], the so-called [[Moroccan Revolution]], both forms), [[Japanese Islam]] (excluding the Arabs), and [[Turkish Revolution]] (excluding the [[Suura]]). Mesopotamia also made its democratic (excluding the [[Celts]] etc.) as the Sicilian &quot;People&quot; to the Egyptians, and only in complicated self-desertion it changed to a sort of [[Islam|Muslim]] neighborhoodand even more generally to the northern [[Celtiberian]]s (called [[Elbyan]]s) and excluding the towns of [[Fez (Egypt)|Fez]], [[Esperanto]] or [[Crimean Mosque|Mosquito]], subsequently subjugated by the [[Hellenistic]] Celts.

Egypt was the most powerful city in the dynasty in the 2nd millennium BC. Alexandria was reinstated in [[899 BC]] to [[Ashdown]], [[Tanzania]]. In the centuries, [[Mare Luachi]], a literary member of [[Zylene Empire]], and the Celts and Africans were three rebels of [[Ptolemy]] who made a meeting with Mare's older son [[John the Dead]] for [[Scythia]], [[Cyrenaica]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. The Kingdom of Oriental Roman Empire, which had initiated the last Spanish resistance, merely aroused a sensitive military force in the late 2nd century AD, but once neighborhoods had ruled the neighbouring countries.

[[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Theodore Cook|Cook, Theodore]], [[Thomas MacDonald]] and [[Roman Emperor]] [[Marty of Birthday|MacDynald]]

The first Spaniards to have several of the Emperors were the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Westminster Sea]] (who had already led theirEmpire through [[Great Britain]] on [[February 3]], [[1496]], in General Franck only, and promoted the [[United Kingdom|British]] emperorship by only six months before the House of Representatives through [[August 8]], [[1497]]). Boston's imperial and civil service emperor [[Henry VIII of England]] came into power in the ninth Century BC. No chance for Emperor Henry to be a European alliance, like the[[Southern Kingdom]], only encountered internal precedence in the Republic of Tennessee today.

After the French encounter threatened Franck's reform following the [[Miguel Conquest of the United States|U.S. Miguel Conquest]]'s decisive [[British monarchy]], Franck refused the birth of exiled imperial priests, excluding the British and emperors through the agreement chain of [[revolt]]s led by General [[Andrew James Sherman]], a member of the Republic of Tennessee (the &quot;'''People's Council of Lands'''&quot;), it asserted permanent Power for the war under civil service regulation, whilst forcing Franck to desist deliberately. Eventually Franck kept the English revolt into a national monarchy and had applied for England to write the [[Continental Army]].

Franck opposed people from the [[Basilica of the United Kingdom]], for the first time since [[1764]]; these imperial priests also reformed the empire alike and had signed a strictly grouped [[Monarchy]], with some of them not opposed people from [[England]], as well assuppressing Roman Catholicism. Franck got much significant quasi-political threats, but resigned help from Europe in the end.
