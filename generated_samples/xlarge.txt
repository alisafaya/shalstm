==History of North Africa (3500 B.C. - 1500 A.D.)==
=== Ancient Egypt ===
''Main articles: [[History of Ancient Egypt]], [[Kush]]''

Africa's earliest evidence of written history was in [[Ancient Egypt]], and the [[Egyptian calendar]] is still used as the standard for dating [[bronze age]] and [[iron age]] cultures throughout the region.

In about 3100 B.C., [[Egypt]] was united under a ruler known as Mena, or [[Menes]], who inaugurated the first of the 30 dynasties intowhich Egypt's ancient history is divided: the [[Old Kingdom|Old]], [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]s and the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. The pyramids at [[Giza]] (near [[Cairo]]), which were built in the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth dynasty]], testify to the power of the pharaonic religion and state. The [[Great Pyramid]], the tomb of [[Pharaoh]] [[Khufu]] (also known as Cheops), is the only surviving monument of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Ancient Egypt reached the peak of its power, wealth, and territorial extent in the period called the New Empire (1567-1085 B.C.).

The Egyptians reached [[Crete]] around 2000 BC and were invaded by [[Indo-European]]s and [[Hyksos]] Semites. They defeated the invaders around 1570 BC and expanded into the [[Aegean sea|Aegean]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], and much of the [[Levant]], as far as the [[Euphrates]].

The importance of Ancient Egypt to the development of Africa has been disputed. The earlier generation of Western [[Africanist]]s generally saw Egypt as a Mediterranean civilization with little impact on the rest of Africa. The more recent historians based in Africa take a very different view seeing Egypt as important to the development of African civilization as Greece was to the development of European. It has been demonstrated that Egypt had considerable contact with [[Ethiopia]] and the upper [[Nile]] valley, south of the [[cataracts of the Nile]] in [[Nubia]]n [[Kush]]. Links and connections to the Sahel and West Africa have been proposed, but are as of yet unproven.

=== Phoenician, Greek and Roman colonization  ===
Separated by the 'sea of sand', the Sahara, [[North Africa]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] have been linked by fluctuating [[trans-Saharan trade]] routes. Phoenician, Greek and Roman history of North Africa can be followed in entries for the [[Roman Empire]] and for its individual provinces in the [[Maghreb]], such as [[Mauretania]], [[Africa (province)|Africa]], [[Tripolitania]], [[Cyrenaica]], [[Aegyptus (province)|Aegyptus]] etc.

In Northern Africa Ethiopia has been the only state which throughout historic times has (except for a brief period during [[World War II]]) maintained its independence.  Countries bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] were colonised and settled by the [[Phoenicia]]ns before 1000 BC. [[Carthage]], founded about [[814 BC]], speedily grew into a city without rival in the Mediterranean. The Phoenicians subdued the [[Berber]] tribes who, then as now, formed the bulk of the population, and became masters of all the habitable region of North Africa west of the [[Great Syrtis]], and found in commerce a source of immense prosperity.

Greeks founded the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in Libya around [[631 BC]]. [[Cyrenaica]] became a flourishing colony, though being hemmed in on all sides by absolute desert it had little or no influence on inner Africa.  The Greeks, however, exerted a powerful influence in Egypt.  To [[Alexander the Great]] the city of [[Alexandria]] owes its foundation ([[332 BC]]), and under the Hellenistic dynasty of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] attempts were made to penetrate southward, and in this way was obtained some knowledge of Ethiopia.

The three powers of Cyrenaica, Egypt and Carthage were even|-start-of-generated-text-|tually proclaimed conventually by fluctuations in the [[Nile]] era. In the middle of the glacial era, one of the major cities of the Colonies, [[Falls]], [[Royal Mediterranean claims town|Cyrenaica]], attempted to improve its influence, the province of [[Cacheux]] was vitally affected by the [[Mesoamerica]]ns and the[[Ashkanazafore]]; the existing [[Britons]] on the other side of the [[Great Syrtims]] were prosperous in the habitable concave period. [[Jerome]] hoped to maintain his orders at [[Fort Salarmonia]] in favour of Ashkanazafore.

From then on, relations between Africa and the Mediterranean were more in the manner of a viciously dominant city north of the [[Ashkanazafore]] than that of [[Byzantium]]. Further estates were built and far surpassed the island of [[Condor]] which instituted stiff mansions during the earlier provinces. The chain of water rapidly resulted in the loss of the precipitation of [[Battle of Fort Dargo|FortDargo]] and sparking pagan threats from the west. While a living dynasty had also been devastated during the songs down from earth, this appearance was not lost. Fort Dargo emerged as sole concern for the entire Mediterranean, with his knights managing to enlighten large posts on his shoulders in his last years of life.

At the latest, the '''Resignation of the Persian Revolution''' had already succeeded in the war of [[Eduard Horton]], descendants of Cyrenaican civilizations, and protected the complete powers of the Imperial Trade Boundaries. At [[Tigris]] ([[806 BC]]), which marked the end of the steppe, the [[Tedescon]], replaced the [[Seven Wonders of the World]]. Many remains of an African-American kingdom came to Egypt in 1018 and after only decades of political turmoil and attack on them, Dargo established the last Battle of the Ancient World.The troops surrounded the peak in [[866 BC]] with [[Horton]] forts. With the Ashkanazafores reaching east, the Tedescon residents proceeded in favour of Battle of Fort Dargo, being much weaker than their past. In [[616 BC]], leading the Egyptians as its commanders, [[Africa]] gained much of its fortune, and [[Merodach-babbie]] tried to implant it for financial consequences with the leaders of the Empire. One of the former 'phoenician' peoples that formed the [[Orthodox]] and [[Armenian Avars|Avars]] managed to establish disputed water mountains and empty its ships in the Sierra Maestra. Of the west enough followed by the well-known Battle of Fort Tigris, captives from the Tedescon tribes living in the province of [[Ghana]] were used to land settlements. Several Cyrenaican armies converted into the entire steppe in [[857 BC]]. The invaders forced their [[first distance]] against the Dargo, behind the '''ancient Nara and Libyan siege of Amrich''' (the [[sahara]]). The Tedescon residents once used establishments for the dissolved Chinese emperor [[Charlemagne]] to impose a peaceful invasion and to political turmoil, defeating all Ashkanazafores. The Tedescon areas were in fact [[Africa]]n, and fromApril [[560 BC]] to [[708 BC]], southern continents became 'northern' and the second lies to the west at [[Alexandria]].

Africa and Libya were mentioned once earlier in an early age in the modern areas of Battle of [[Mondies]], [[Baluchistan]], [[Macau]],[[San Siegelina]], [[France]], [[Paris]], [[Vallenwise]] and [[Venice]].

During this time, the Tedescon tribes still retain in the kingdom of Africa, with the rest of Egypt as well as the [[Tedescon|Seven Countries]]. The Seven Wonders of the Seven Wonders (Seven Wonders of the Ashkanazafores) have come to persist at different times in their history since both men were found dead.

The predominant population of Africa, as well as many of its Seven Wonders, were in control until after the rise of [[India]]n troops from Africa with Seven Wonders of the Ashkanazafores and [[India]] from [[1946 BC]] to [[1922]].

Africa, with forts and exploitations, was inhabited by the [[Armenians]] f
